So the file tux is a linux script. (a linux script is any file that it is when it is runned either by putting the file to /bin (mv'ing (git (get it cuz its github) it cuz to move a file in linux terminal command line the command is mv) it to bin makes it a command ) (the intended way) it actually dose something instead of something like "-bash: bs-that-dosent-exists: command not found" ) the (tux) script is just says 1 line 

Tux source code

cat (dirictory if you put it some where else) tuxascii

Ya thats it

And the tuxascii file is just a ascii pic of tux
